// don't support sending images/media in tool result messages - they only accept
// text in tool results. However, they DO support images in user messages.
//
// If we send media in tool results to these providers, the API returns an error.
//
// Solution: For these providers, we:
//  1. Replace the media in the tool result with a text placeholder
//  2. Inject a user message immediately after with the image as a file attachment
//  3. This maintains the tool execution flow while working around API limitations
//
// Anthropic and Bedrock support images natively in tool results, so we skip
// this workaround for them.

// Example transformation:
//
//	BEFORE: [tool result: image data]
//	AFTER:  [tool result: "Image loaded - see attached"], [user: image attachment]
